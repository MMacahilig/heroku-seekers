      CareerSeekers is non-profit social enterprise that works with leading organisations to create employment opportunities for asylum seekers <br>
      and refugees who aspire to obtain professional employment.Our program supports two distinct groups of asylum seekers and refugees: <br><br>

      Mid-career Professionals â€“ those with tertiary qualifications and professional work experience who strive to re-establish their careers <br>
      in Australia. These participants undertake paid internships lasting twelve weeks that provide local experience, a local reference and help <br>
      them establish a network within their chosen profession. <br><br>

      University students - full-time university students who undertake paid internships during university breaks in an effort to link their studies <br>
      with practical work experience. The CareerSeekers university program aligns to existing corporate internship programs. <br><br>

      CareerSeekers is endorsed as an Item 1 Deductible Gift Recipient organisation.

    <h3>What do we do?</h3>
    <div class='col-lg-12'>
      <p>
        The CareerSeekers program is an adaptation of the successful CareerTrackers Indigenous Internship Program. <br><br>

        There are thousands of refugees and asylum seekers that enter Australia with valuable skills and professional training but lack work experience<br>
         in Australia. Here at CareerSeekers, we provide refugees and asylum seekers a gateway to gain Australian work experience through internship <br>
         opportunities with our corporate partners.<br><br>

        As part of providing internship opportunities for refugees and asylum seekers, CareerSeekers support each participant in the program by providing<br>
         them with training to create their professional CV, build up their interview skills, and advice in adapting to the Australian workplace and culture.

    <h3>Professional Experience for the Future</h3>
    <div class='col-lg-12'>
      <p>
        Part of the CareerSeekers program involves the generation of internship opportunities that cater specifically to the desired experience of each participant.<br>
         The internship opportunities within our corporate partners have been designed with the participant at the core, they are not the standard opportunities <br>
         provided by our corporate partners but are new internship placements created specifically for CareerSeekers participants.<br><br>

        The goal for the generated internship for refugees and asylum seeker participants is to ensure that they have the skills to progress their careers in Australia.<br>
         We want our participants to have the skills and experience needed to enter into the Australian workforce and achieve their dreams.
