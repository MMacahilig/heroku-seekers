  main/about_us_text: "<p>Many asylum seekers and refugees arrive in\r\nAustralia
    at an early age.  They complete\r\ntheir schooling and have the ambition to participate
    in further studies.  As they may be the first in their family to\r\nnavigate tertiary
    education and professional employment, the CareerSeekers\r\nuniversity program
    is key in helping many young asylum seekers and refugees\r\nachieve their goals.
    &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As university students, participants\r\nundertake
    their internships during university breaks and sometimes work\r\nyear-round as
    they near the end of their degree.  The program is designed for students to\r\nreturn
    to their workplace each year while completing their degree.  Ultimately we want
    to see interns convert\r\ninto full-time graduate employment at the completion
    of their studies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key aspects of the CareerSeekers
