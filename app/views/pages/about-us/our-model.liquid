    is an adaptation of the\r\nsuccessful
    \r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.careertrackers.org.au/\"
    title=\"Link: http://careertrackers.org.au/) \">CareerTrackers Indigenous Internship Program</a>&nbsp;.
    \ </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, the Founder &amp; CEO of\r\nCareerTrackers sought
    to expand the model to support corporate Australia’s\r\nfocus on multicultural
    diversity while tackling the issue of underemployment of\r\nasylum seekers and
    refugees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Core to the success of CareerSeekers are the\r\nfollowing
    elements:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n
    <p><b>Participants\r\nat the Core</b>
    – from day one we have adopted the belief that the interests of our participants must always drive every aspect of our program.
    Our approach aims to first find the willing individuals, work with them to define a career path, and then build
    relationships between prospective employers and individuals keen to work. Our Participants at the Core philosophy has
    driven the design of the CareerSeekers program.  It is embedded in every decision we make.  It is an easy compass for decision making.
   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Inspire\r\nExcellence</b>
    – the purpose of CareerSeekers is to Create Opportunities that Inspire Excellence.
    It is this purpose the drives us to push our participants in every aspect of our program.
    We believe our participants can achieve anything they set their minds to.  We also believe it is
    imperative that employers provide challenging work.  It is essential that interns and employers
    expect the most of each other.  Without this expectation, we do not believe excellence can occur.
   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
   <p><b>Meaningful\r\nPartnerships</b>
     – partnering is our strength.  We recognise that partnerships are essential to our success.
     We also recognise that these partnerships must be long-term as this is a key element for
     building trust with our stakeholders.   We want to partner with organisations providing a range of
     support to asylum seekers and refugees.  We see partnering as a way to drive efficiency
     in the social enterprise ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p><p></p>"
